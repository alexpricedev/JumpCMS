# JumpCMS

**NOTE: Super early version (basically a prototype) not intended for
production use.**

JumpCMS is a content management system framework. It's designed for the rapid
of bespoke content management systems. It leverages the flexibility of NoSQL
databases to allow the schema to be defined by React components.

Creating a new page type is as simple as exporting a new template component.

JumpCMS is headless, meaning it doens't handle any rendering of templates, it
simply exposes REST endpoints. This means you can built your front-end however
you like!

## Try it out

The API and admin interface are seperate apps. Go and read thier individual
quick start guides to get JumpCMS running on your machine.

There is also a simple example website showing how you could build the
front-end to consume the API data.
